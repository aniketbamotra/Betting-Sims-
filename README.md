# Introduction

Purebet is a decentralised, non-custodial betting exchange based on the Solana blockchain, custom built from the ground up to give the optimal betting experience.  Purebet relieves users of the stress of missing deposits, withdrawal delays, and account closures by working seamlessly and permissionlessly on the blockchain. We believe the future of sports betting and prediction markets is community-focused, open-source, permissionless, and immutable. Purebet is designed by sports bettors, for sports bettors to give the simplest and smoothest sports betting experience possible.
